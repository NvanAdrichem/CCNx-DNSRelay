``DNS Relay for CCNx'' is a software package that relays DNS requests from a local client to a remote server using a CCNx Named Data Network.
Since the NDN is used to forward the DNS request to the server, duplicate requests can be served from in-network caches.

The package contains a relay-client and a relay-server.
The relay-client acts like a local DNS server to the computer by binding on DNS port 53, and retransmitting received queries using the NDN to the relay-server.
The relay-server listens for incoming DNS queries on the NDN, and retransmits them using UDP to a preconfigured recursive DNS server.
Using this relay-service one enables to use NDN to efficiently retrieve information stored in the DNS system.

If you have any questions or are experiencing any troubles while using this program, please contact Niels van Adrichem at n.l.m.vanadrichem _AT_ tudelft _DOT_ nl (replace the _AT_  and _DOT_ accordingly), I will gladly help you.

1. Prerequisites
- This software has been build and tested using the CCNx architecture version 0.6.2., first of all make sure you have a working installation of version 0.6.2.
- Make sure you have a properly configure JDK and JRE to compile and run the program, for example I use the Sun JRE and JDK 1.7.
  
2. Building
	Download the source of ``DNS Relay for CCNx'' and place it in a folder of your preference (I use /home/username/tools/CCNx-DNSRelay, from here on I assume you have a console open in this directory).
	The compilation and running of ``DNS Relay for CCNx'' depend on a few jar-files carried along with CCNx-0.6.2 which should be in the folder lib.
	You can either:
		1) Extract the folder from this repository if you use CCNx 0.6.2.
		2)	create the folder lib (mkdir lib)
			copy the files ccn.jar, bcprov-jdk16-143.jar from $CCNX_HOME/lib (cp $CCNX_HOME/lib/ccn.jar $CCNX_HOME/lib/bcprov-jdk16-143.jar lib)
		3) create a symlink to your $CCNX_HOME/lib folder (in case you frequently patch your CCNx) (ln -s $CCNX_HOME/lib lib) and 
		2 and 3b) Download org.xbill.dns_2.1.3.jar from http://www.dnsjava.org and save it in the lib folder.

	Run tools/compile.sh to build the source.
	A folder named bin holding the class-files is created automatically

3. Configuration and Usage
	The relay-client can be starting by using the following parameters on the class "Relay":
		"client"; indicating that you want to start the client-side relay.
		<NDN-name>; containing the NDN name under which the relay-server is available. Be sure that this address is routable within your network.
	The file tools/relay-client contains an example of running the client.
	Be sure to
		a) shutdown any local DNS-servers in advance (use `netstat -an | grep 53' to check if any are running)
		b) configure your OS to use 127.0.0.1 as DNS server, as the client will act like it is a local DNS server
		c) run the client as root or use sudo if your OS disallows registering low-numbered port-numbers.
		
	The relay-server can be started by using the following parameters on the class "Relay":
		"server"; indicating that you want to start the server-side relay.
		<NDN-name>; the name under which this service is reachable for its clients.
		[<IP-address>]; optionally, the IP address of a DNS server if you want to use another DNS server than the locally configured DNS-server.
	The file tools/relay-server contains an example of running the server relay.
		
4. Future work
	- Currently there is only support for single-question queries, which make up the largest part of all DNS traffic.
	  We need to consider if we want to enhance the relaying mechanism to also support TSIG, UPDATE and other queries.

	This project could not have been possible without the efforts of Brian Wellington on the `dnsjava' project, this implementation relies heavily on his library (http://www.dnsjava.org).
